    Seed Manager.
    This class is in charge of providing the next seed to execute by prioritizing
    them. It also holds various sets of pending seeds, corpus, crashes etc and
    manages them in the workspace.

    * pending seeds (kept in the seed scheduler). These are the seeds that might
      be selected to be run
    * seed consumed (corpus, crash, hangs) which are seeds not meant to be re-executed
      as they cannot lead to new paths, all candidate paths are UNSAT etc.
